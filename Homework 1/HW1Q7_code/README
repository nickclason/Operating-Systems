The Makefile that comes with this problem creates all necessary executables.

Simply enter

	make all

and then run the test script by entering

	./testpid

You should not see the message PID ALREADY IN USE. However, if you do 
it may be due to the fact that you have not created a thread-safe
technique for allocating pids. In Chapter 5 there will an exercise which creates
a thread-safe pid manager.
